//Question 45
//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car
// in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer
//  and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number
//  of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required
// information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an
//  optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function car(
  manufacturer: string,
  modelName: string,
  ...carSpecs: [string, any][]
) {
  let car = { manufacturer, modelName };
  carSpecs.forEach(([key, value]) => (car[key] = value));
  return car;
}

console.log(car("Toyota", "Fortuner", ["color", "white"]));
console.log(car("LandRover", "Defender", ["color", "skin"]));
console.log(car("suzuki", "Mehran", ["color", "white"]));
