//question14:Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
var guestList = ["Areesha", "Sana", "wajid", "salman", "haider"];
guestList.forEach(function (guest) {
    console.log("Dear ".concat(guest, " you are invited on dinner on sunday night\nThank you!"));
});
