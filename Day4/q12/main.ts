//question12;Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
 let names :string[]= ["Aresha","sana","taha","ahmed","raza"]

 names.forEach(friends =>{
    console.log(`Dear ${friends} how are you!`);
    
 })
