//         Question 34
// Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza.
//  Store these pizza names in a array,
//  and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
var favoritePizza = ['Chicken Fajeta', 'pepperoni', 'Margherita'];
favoritePizza.forEach(function (pizza) {
    console.log("I like ".concat(pizza, " pizza!"));
});
//Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states how much you like pizza.
console.log('I  really love pizza!');
